# Privacy Policy

**Last Updated: December 29, 2025**

## Overview

Chat ("the App") is designed with privacy as a core principle. All data stays on your device. We do not collect, store, or transmit any personal information.

## Data Collection

**We collect nothing.**

The App does not:
- Collect personal information
- Create user accounts
- Require email, phone number, or any identifiers
- Use analytics or tracking tools
- Contain advertising SDKs
- Transmit data to external servers
- Access your contacts, location, camera, or microphone

## Data Storage

All data created by the App is stored locally on your device:

- **Conversations**: Your chat messages are saved only on your device in the app's private storage.
- **User Memory**: Preferences and facts you share are stored locally to personalize your experience.
- **Conversation Summaries**: Summaries of past chats are generated and stored on-device.

This data is protected by iOS file protection and is not accessible to other apps or to us.

## On-Device AI Processing

The App uses Apple's on-device language model (Apple Intelligence) to generate responses. All AI processing happens locally on your device. Your conversations are never sent to external AI services or cloud servers.

## Third-Party Services

The App does not integrate with any third-party services, APIs, or SDKs. There are no external dependencies that could access your data.

## Data Sharing

We do not share any data because we do not have access to any data. Your conversations exist only on your device.

## Data Retention

Data remains on your device until you delete it. You can:
- Delete individual conversations within the App
- Delete all data by uninstalling the App

We have no ability to access, recover, or delete your data remotely.

## Children's Privacy

The App does not collect any personal information from anyone, including children under 13. Since no data leaves your device, there are no age-related data concerns.

## Security

Your data is protected by:
- iOS file protection (encryption at rest)
- App sandboxing (data isolated from other apps)
- No network transmission (data never leaves your device)

## Your Rights

Since we don't collect your data, traditional data rights (access, deletion, portability) are handled entirely on your device. You have complete control over your data through the App and iOS settings.

## Changes to This Policy

If we update this Privacy Policy, we will post the new version in the App and update the "Last Updated" date. Since we don't collect contact information, we cannot notify you directly of changes.

**Summary**: Your data stays on your device. We don't collect it, we can't see it, and we never will.
